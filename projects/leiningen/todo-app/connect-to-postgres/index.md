## Using JDBC for Relational Databases
Java Database connnectivity is a common way to connect to a relational database and has very widespread database support.

[next.jdbc](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc) is a Clojure library to send SQL statements over jdbc or use a DSL such as [HoneySQL](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql)) to work with these databases.
