guide to developing server-side web services and API's from the ground up using Clojure, aiming for a simple and clean design using functional programming concepts.\nA REPL Driven development workflow provides a fast feedback loop, showing how the code works as its being written.\nRelevant theory and background reading is included whilst keeping the practical focus of this guide on build projects and experimenting with the code.\nClojure CLI and deps.edn\nProjects are created and configure using Clojure CLI tools, using deps.edn for configuration.  Older content uses Leiningen for project configuration.\nComponent / library approach\nThe Clojure community has a diverse set of libraries which focus on a specific need. These libraries are assembled to rapidly develop a tailored solution.  Using a library approach means those libraries are relatively simple to replace with alternatives or your own libraries.\nProject templates are used to create projects that include commonly used libraries, along with example code, demonstrating how common services can be assembled. Templates have options to configure the project as its created, customising to the specific needs of the problem being solved.\nClojure does not focus on the classic framework approach like Rails or Spring, for a very good reason.\nFrameworks are design decisions others have made without knowing the context of the current problem at hand, so there is no guarantee on how many of those decisions are relevant. Frameworks tend to include many features not relevant to the current problem. Frameworks can be over relied upon, taking away an opportunity to think about the most relevant solution.\n\nDiscussions and feedback\n\nGet a free Clojurians slack community account\nLicense\n\n\n\n\n\n Practicalli Clojure Web Services by Practicalli is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 \n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"requirements.html":{"url":"requirements.html","title":"Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Requirements\nPracticalli provides an install guide for Clojure and a wide selection of Clojure aware editors\nRecommended development tools for this guide are:\n\nJava OpenJDK version 17 (version 11 onward should work)\nClojure CLI and practicalli/clojure-deps-edn aliases\nA Clojure aware editor\n\nCode examples can be used with any Clojure build tool, although this guide focuses on using Clojure CLI tools.

You can skip Heroku if you only wish to run your applications locally or have some other service to deploy them.  Install Postgres database locally if not using a service such as Heroku.\n Why not docker?Practicalli tends toward the simplest and developer oriented architectural decisions, making deployment from source a trivial process with adherence to the 12 Factor design approach.Docker does add a layer of indirection and more configuration is required to deploy Clojure Services in this manor.  Practicalli does welcome Docker (and Docker compose, kubernetes, GitPod, etc) contributions to this guide, allowing Practicalli more time to focus on Clojure specific content.  Practicalli may cover these aspects if enough interested is shown.\nPostgreSQL Alternatives\nPracticalli is considering other persistent storage approaches for this guide and any contributions in this regard is much appreciated\n\nCrux - an open source document database with bitemporal graph queries\nDatomic - a transactional database with a flexible data model, elastic scaling, and rich queries.\nAmazon Aurora - MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible cloud native relational database\nAmazon DynamoDB with Clojure Faraday library - for persisting JSON like data structures\n\nLeiningen approach (to be archived)\nInstall Leiningen for the Leiningen Todo App project and test the Leinigen install by running the command lein version in a terminal application.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"clojure-web-services-overview.html":{"url":"clojure-web-services-overview.html","title":"Overview","keywords":"","body":"Overview of Clojure Web Services\n\nA Web service receives data, does something with that data and returns data as a result.  This is the essence of how a function works in Clojure.  So its really simple to design web apps with Clojure.\nClojure data is managed via immutable data structures. The majority of the Clojure code will be stateless or managing state with immutable data structures, therefore code for services will be less complex and less prone to conflicts.\nRelevant changes to data is persisted to a data store, e.g. PostgreSQL, Datomic or XTDB\nSo reliable services are very easy to build and simple to scale via parallelism.\nLibraries over frameworks\nClojure takes a modular approach to building services, assembling commonly used libraries from the community.\nJava Interoperability is simple in Clojure, so its trivial to use Java libraries or any libraries that run on the JVM (Scala, Jython, etc.).\nWeb services in Clojure are typically built from a collection of highly focused libraries.  Each library has a specific focus and enables a modular approach, as you can swap components & libraries easily should there be value in a different approach.\nCommon libraries for web app development include:\n\nRing - a web application library\nCompojure - an simple way to define routes for your ring webapp\nHiccup or Selmer- to generate HTML from Clojure data structures\nPedestal\njdbc.next - a modern low-level Clojure wrapper for JDBC access to databases\nclojure.java.jdbc - simple low level SQL library\nKorma, YesQL, hugSql - database abstraction layers\nPrismatic Schema - database schema mapping\nMigratus - database migrations (and all the things)\n\nLarge frameworks constrain the design of a service, forcing development to live inside the constraints of that framework as it can be difficult to break out of the design the framework imposes.\nProject templates\nProjects can be created from templates to avoid starting from scratch each time.\nProject templates\nUsing Leiningen\nlein new template-name project-name\n\nUsing Clojure CLI\nclojure -T:project/new :template figwheel :name practicalli/landing-page\n\nThere are many great templates to try that provide insight into building webapps in Clojure.\n\ncompojure - a common web application approach with ring and compojure\ncompojure-api - quickly build API's with ring, compojure and openapi (swagger) for self-documentation\nluminus - a flexible template to create server-side and full stack web applications\npedestal-service - an opinionated, extensible & scalable framework\nduct - data-oriented production-grade server-side web applications\nJUXT Edge - a curated base project to build your own applications and services\n\nYou can find a range of project templates by searching for lein-template on Clojars.org.  There is also a guide to writing templates on Leiningen.org\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"projects/status-monitor-deps/":{"url":"projects/status-monitor-deps/","title":"Status Monitor","keywords":"","body":"Status Monitor project with Clojure tools\nA status monitor dashboard to show operational status of a range of services.\nA server-side web application using\n\nring and compojure for webapp request management\nbulma CSS library for styling\nhiccup for writing html in Clojure syntax\nSVG graphics for status graphics\nclojure.spec for validating functions and svg definitions in Clojure\n\nCreating a project\nUse clj-new to create the project (alias defined in practicalli/clojure-deps-edn)\nclojure -T:project/new :template app :name practicalli/status-monitor-service :output status-monitor-service\n\n Use practicalli/clojure-deps-edn to add common toolsfork and clone the practicalli/clojure-deps-edn GitHub repository to instantly have access to dozens of tools for Clojure software development\nTweaking the project\nSome minor tweaks are made to the project before starting the application development\n\ndescribe the project and how it can be used in the README\ndelete the LICENSE file and use a Creative Commons in the README\nformat the deps.edn file for readability\n\nCode repository\nThe code for this section can be found on practicalli/status-monitor-service\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"projects/status-monitor-deps/application-server.html":{"url":"projects/status-monitor-deps/application-server.html","title":"Application server","keywords":"","body":"Add an embedded web application server\nThe status monitor service runs on top of an application server which handles the infrastructure of messaging over https and other Internet protocols.\nThere are several libraries to provide this, ring and http-kit being the most common.\nAdd dependencies for application server and routing\nEdit the deps.edn file for the project.\nAdd the http-kit library library for the application server\nAdd the compojure library for routing of requests\n:deps\n {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version \"1.10.1\"}\n  http-kit            {:mvn/version \"2.3.0\"}\n  compojure           {:mvn/version \"1.6.1\"}}\n\nAdd code to start the application server\nEdit the src/practicalli/status_monitor_service.clj file\nInclude the http-kit server namespace and the compojure core namespace as requires in the ns definition.\n(ns practicalli.status-monitor-service\n  (:gen-class)\n  (:require [org.httpkit.server :as app-server]\n            [compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET]]))\n\nAdd an atom to hold a reference to the running application server.

Heroku automatically assigns a port number for an application to listen upon when creating a contain in which the application will run.  This port number is set using the PORT environment variable and is available to the application on startup.  Using the PORT environment variable ensures the Clojure application will receive requests.\nweb: java -jar status-monitor-service.jar $PORT\n\nSpecifying a Java version\nCreate a system.properties and specify the Java version to use for the application. Java 1.8 is the default version use on Heroku, however, our development environment is Java 17, so add a property to set the Java runtime to version 17.\njava.runtime.version=17\n\nHeroku configuration\nLogin to the Heroku dashboard and create a new application.\nIn the Heroku dashboard, open the application Settings and add a Config Vars using the name CLOJURE_CLI_VERSION with a value of 1.10.1.727\n\nCircleCI configuration with Heroku Orb\nEdit the .circleci/config.yml file and add the heroku orb and a workflow to call the orb task.  The workflow has a dependency on the build job, so that will take place first.\nThe Heroku workflow will build the application from source code using the heroku/deploy-via-git.  Only changes pushed to the live branch of the GitHub repository will be used in the Heroku deploy workflow.\n\nFeature branches can be deployed on Heroku by creating an additional Heroku application and push the branch to it.

If the tests pass, then the Heroku deploy workflow starts.\nThe two stages can be seen in the dashboard as the pipeline runs.\n\nNow visit the deployed Heroku application to see it in action.\nTroubleshooting\nIf there are issues, then use the Heroku toolbelt to look at the logs.  In a command line terminal, issue the login command which opens a web browser to login to Heroku.  Once logged in, run the heroku logs command to view the latest logs\nheroku login\n\nheroku logs --app status-monitor-service\n\nThe logs can also be viewed live, as the application is being deployed by including the --tail option when running the heroku logs command in a terminal\nheroku logs --app status-monitor-service --tail\n\nThe example Heroku logs show that the status-monitor-service is using the default port number if non is supplied as an argument, rather than Heroku assigned port.  Heroku therefore considers the application as unresponsive and sets it status to crashed, tearing down the container the application is running in.\nThese logs were generated before adding the $PORT to the command in the Procfile.\n\nNo forced pushes\nHeroku doesn't like force Git pushes coming via CircleCI.\n\nTo get around this, either don't do force pushes to GitHub, or add the Heroku repository for the project as a remote to local git repository.\nHeroku repository details in heroku dashboard Settings under App Information\nChanges can now be pushed, ideally using force-with-lease to Heroku repository.\ngit push heroku live:master\n\nHeroku only builds from a branch called master, so the above command pushes the local live branch to the remote master branch on Heroku.\n\nStopping the application\nAn application can be run for free on Heroku with the monthly free credits provided.

Pushing code to another branch of the heroku remote has no effect. Using the live:local form will push the local live branch to the remote main branch on Heroku.\n\nThis triggers a build by CircleCI.  The build downloads the dependencies and runs the unit tests.  If the tests pass, then the Heroku deploy workflow starts.\nThe two stages can be seen in the dashboard as the pipeline runs.\n\nNow visit the deployed Heroku application to see it in action.\nTroubleshooting\nIf there are issues, then use the Heroku toolbelt to look at the logs.  In a command line terminal, issue the login command which opens a web browser to login to Heroku.  Once logged in, run the heroku logs command to view the latest logs\nheroku login\n\nheroku logs --app banking-on-clojure\n\nThe logs can also be viewed live, as the application is being deployed by including the --tail option when running the heroku logs command in a terminal\nheroku logs --app banking-on-clojure --tail\n\nThe example Heroku logs show that the banking-on-clojure is using the default port number if non is supplied as an argument, rather than Heroku assigned port.  Heroku therefore considers the application as unresponsive and sets it status to crashed, tearing down the container the application is running in.\nThese logs were generated before adding the $PORT to the command in the Procfile.\n\nNo forced pushes\nHeroku doesn't like force Git pushes coming via CircleCI.\n\nTo get around this, either don't do force pushes to GitHub, or add the Heroku repository for the project as a remote to local git repository.\nHeroku repository details in heroku dashboard Settings under App Information\nChanges can now be pushed, ideally using force-with-lease to Heroku repository.\nStopping the application\nAn application can be run for free on Heroku with the monthly free credits provided.  However, to make the most out of these free credits then applications not in use should be shut down\nRun the following command in the root of the Clojure project.\nheroku ps:stop banking-on-clojure\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"projects/banking-on-clojure/unit-tests.html":{"url":"projects/banking-on-clojure/unit-tests.html","title":"Unit Tests","keywords":"","body":"Unit tests\nIn Clojure web applications the handler functions are the main focus of the unit tests.\nCreate the file test/practicalli/request-handler-test.clj to contain the unit tests.\nDefine the request-handler-test namespace, including other namespaces that should be required.\nThe ring.mock.request library is added to simulate request calls to the handlers.\n(ns practicalli.request-handler-test\n  (:require [practicalli.request-handler :as SUT]\n            [clojure.test :refer [deftest is testing]]\n            [ring.mock.request :as mock]))\n\nAdd unit tests for each handler that will be created in practicalli.request-handler.\nA simple starting point for tests is to check the correct HTTP status code is being returned.\nring.mock.request library contains a request function that will generate a mock request hash-map from a given HTTP protocol (:get :post etc.) and a address.\n(deftest welcome-page-test\n  (testing \"Testing elements on the welcome page\"\n    (is (= 200\n           (:status (SUT/welcome-page (mock/request :get \"/\")))))))\n\nEnsuring a status code in handlers\nThe ring.util.response namespace is added to the practicalli.request-handlers namespace.

Each account has an account holder, a current balance and a date of when the current balance was last updated.\ntransaction_history contains every transaction that takes place in the bank.  Each transaction is related to a specific account.  The current balance for an account is built from all the transactions for a specific account.  The number of transactions used to calculate the current balance is reduced by using the last_updated value from accounts.\n\nOrganising the code\nThe SQL statements that create the database tables will be bound to a suitable name using def.  The value will be a vector containing the string of the SQL statement.\nThe SQL statements are generated by the DBever database management tool.  The tables are created in DBeaver and the DDL script is exported for each table and pasted in the Clojure code.\nA create-tables helper function executes the given SQL statements on a specific data source, from within a transaction so that all table are either created or none are created.\ndb-specification-dev is a name bound to the database specification map for the development database.

There may be data types for each specific database that provide more efficient ways of managing unique ids.  For the scope of this project, using a UUID is acceptable.\nDefine ACCOUNTS table\nDefine the SQL statement to create the ACCOUNTS\nEach account is associated with an ACCOUNT_HOLDER_ID so that all the accounts belonging to a customer can be easily found.\nThe current balance holds the value of credit in an account at the time of the last updated date.  The current_balance is calculated from the values in the transaction_history and updates to the current_balance will update the last_updated value.  This provides a very simplistic mechanism for quickly presenting the value of an account.\n(def schema-accounts-table\n  [\"CREATE TABLE PUBLIC.ACCOUNTS(\n     ACCOUNT_ID UUID(16) NOT NULL,\n     ACCOUNT_NUMBER INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n     ACCOUNT_SORT_CODE VARCHAR(6),\n     ACCOUNT_NAME VARCHAR(32),\n     CURRENT_BALANCE VARCHAR(255),\n     LAST_UPDATED DATE,\n     ACCOUNT_HOLDER_ID VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n     CONSTRAINT ACCOUNTS_PK PRIMARY KEY (ACCOUNT_ID))\"] )\n\nDefine TRANSACTION_HISTORY table\nDefine the SQL statement to create the ACCOUNTS\nAll transactions include a value of the transaction, a reference to explain the purpose of the transaction, a date the transaction occurred, the account the transaction comes from and the account the transaction goes to.\n(def schema-transaction-history-table\n  [\"CREATE TABLE PUBLIC.TRANSACTION_HISTORY(\n     TRANSACTION_ID UUID(16) NOT NULL,\n     TRANSACTION_VALUE INTEGER NOT NULL,\n     TRANSACTION_REFERENCE VARCHAR(32),\n     TRANSACTION_DATE DATE,\n     ACCOUNT_FROM INTEGER,\n     ACCOUNT_TO INTEGER,\n     CONSTRAINT TRANSACTION_HISTORY_PK PRIMARY KEY (TRANSACTION_ID))\"])\n\n Constraint NamingConstraints are used to add Primary Keys to database tables.

It is recommended to use meaningful names for identifiers to trace the source of errors and also support maintenance of the overall database design.\nExecute Table schema in the development database\nDefine a function to use the table creation SQL statements and execute them on the given database.\nThe function uses with-open to create and manage a connection, closing that connection when the function has completed.\n(defn create-table\n  \"Establish a connection to the data source and create a table within a transaction.\n  Close the database connection.\n  Arguments:\n  - table-schemas: a vector containing an sql statements to create a table\"\n  [table-schema data-spec]\n\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection data-spec)]\n    (jdbc/execute! connection  table-schemas)))\n\n with-open - managing resourceswith-open ensures that resources get closed and clearly defines the scope of the using the resource.This helps the developer avoid using Clojure’s lazy sequences in a with-open block.  Within the scope of the with-open expression it is important to make sure that the result is eagerly evaluated to avoid accessing the resource after it’s closed, or fall foul of the \"ResultSet closed\" or \"transaction closed\" errors.\nRefactor the function to execute all the SQL statements in a transaction, so either all the databases are created or none are.\nUsing transactions can help prevent databases becoming in an inconsistent state due to only partial completion of a set of SQL statements.\n(defn create-tables\n  \"Establish a connection to the data source and create all tables within a transaction.\n  Close the database connection.\n  Arguments:\n  - table-schemas: a vector of sql statements, each creating a table\"\n  [table-schemas data-spec]\n\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection data-spec)]\n    (jdbc/with-transaction [transaction connection]\n      (doseq [sql-statement table-schemas]\n        (jdbc/execute! transaction sql-statement) ))))\n\n Refactor for connection poolswith-open function can be removed from the create-tables function when using a connection pool, passing the existing connection from the pool to the jdbc/with-transaction function.\nCalling the create-tables function will create the database tables in the development database.\nThe H2 database writes the tables to disk in the banking-on-clojure.mv.db file.  Unless the table is dropped, there is no need to evaluate this function again.\nViewing tables in the database\n(defn information-tables\n  [data-source]\n  (jdbc/execute!\n    data-source\n    [\"select * from information_schema.tables\"])\n\nCreate a helper function to show the schema of any particular table.  The function takes a table name and using str to combine table name with the rest of the SQL statement.\n(defn show-schema\n  [table-name]\n  (jdbc/execute!\n    data-source\n    [(str \"show columns from \" table-name)]))\n\nA specific schema can be viewed by calling the show-schema function\n(show-schema \"accounts\")\n\nRefactor the show-schema function to take the data source as an argument as well as the table name.  The function is then usable for development, staging and production data sources (although its not generally advisable to update production database from a REPL in the development environment once its live)\n(defn show-schema\n  [data-source table-name]\n  (jdbc/execute! data-source [(str \"show columns from \" table-name)]))\n\nThe connection is not manged though, so refactor again and add the with-open command to ensure the connection is closed once the function has finished.\n(defn show-schema\n  [db-spec table-name]\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection db-spec)]\n    (jdbc/execute! connection [(str \"SHOW COLUMNS FROM \" table-name)])))\n\nRemoving (dropping) database tables\nA helper function for removing tables from the database, dropping the data and the schema of the table.\ndrop-table function only differs from the show-schema function in the specific SQL statement it uses.\n(defn drop-table\n  [db-spec table-name]\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-datasource db-spec)]\n    (jdbc/execute! connection [(str \"DROP TABLE \" table-name)])))\n\n\nA generic helper function could be used if the SQL statement were also an argument.\n\nManaging database tables from the REPL\nWhen designing the database schema it can be useful to iterate quickly around the design.  Using a Rich Comment Block to hold expressions to create show and drop tables is an effective way to manage the database schema quickly.\n(comment  ;; Managing Schemas\n\n  ;; Create all tables in the development database\n  (create-tables [schema-account-holders-table schema-accounts-table schema-transaction-history-table]\n                 db-specification-dev)\n\n  ;; View application table schema in development database\n  (show-schema data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.ACCOUNT_HOLDERS\")\n  (show-schema data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.ACCOUNTS\")\n  (show-schema data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.TRANSACTION_HISTORY\")\n\n  ;; View database system schema in development database\n  (show-schema data-source-dev \"INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES\")\n\n  ;; Remove tables from the development database\n  (drop-table data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.ACCOUNT_HOLDERS\")\n  (drop-table data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.ACCOUNTS\")\n  (drop-table data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.TRANSACTION_HISTORY\"))\n\n  Manage database schema with MigratusMigratus provides an elegant approach to evolving database schema\n\n Common errorsSyntax error in SQL statement can occur if the SQL statement is not correct, the most common cause is a missing comma.Databases do not always support exactly the same SQL syntax, especially around types and more advanced features.  SQL statements may not work exactly the same for each database.  Using tools like DBever will generated SQL expressions for specific databases.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"projects/banking-on-clojure/database-queries.html":{"url":"projects/banking-on-clojure/database-queries.html","title":"Database queries","keywords":"","body":"Defining Database Queries\nUsing the SQL statement for Inserting records as an example, several different approached are covered for defining database queries.

The first time the def is evaluated, the java-util.UUID/randomUUID function is evaluated to a specific value and that value is cached.\nUsing the account-holder-jenny name in other code will use the cache until the def expression is forcefully evaluated (by the developer or by restarting the REPL).\nUsing next.jdbc friendly functions\nUsing next.jdbc.sql functions.  For example:\n(jdbc-sql/insert! ds :address {:name \"A. Person\" :email \"albert@person.org\"})\n\nFor the banking-on-clojure project this would take the form\n(defn add-account-holder\n  [account-holder-id data-source]\n  (jdbc-sql/insert!\n    data-source\n    :table-name {:column-name \"value\" ,,,}))\n\nIn this example, the next.jdbc insert! function is used to add an account holder record.\n(defn add-account-holder\n  [account-holder-id db-spec]\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection db-spec)]\n    (jdbc-sql/insert!\n      connection\n      :public.account_holders {:account_holder_id      account-holder-id\n                               :first_name             \"Rachel\"\n                               :last_name              \"Rocketpack\"\n                               :email_address          \"rach@rocketpack.org\"\n                               :residential_address    \"1 Ultimate Question Lane, Altar IV\"\n                               :social_security_number \"BB104312D\"})))\n\nCalling the function with generated data.\n(add-account-holder (java.util.UUID/randomUUID) db-specification-dev)\n\nGeneric insert function with next.jdbc.sql\n(defn insert-record\n  [table record-data db-spec]\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection db-spec)]\n    (jdbc-sql/insert! connection table record-data)))\n\nThe data to pass in looks familiar.

When there are cyclic namespace dependencies a warning is returned when evaluating any of the namespaces involved.\nA good way to spot cyclic load dependencies it to regularly run a test runner on the code, or even set up a test runner to watch for changes to the file system which then triggers an automatic test run.  For example, kaocha --watch.\nTips on avoiding  cyclic load dependencies\n\nAdd comment sections describing the purpose of the different parts of code, creating logical separation of code.  Refactor of namespaces is far easier to see and helps ensure related code is kept together.\nEnsure test and specification code is in its own namespace.  Keeping the right level of abstraction in tests and clojure spec test.check can help avoid issues.\nUse require to add dependent namespaces, preferably using a meaningful :as alias or using :refer for only the function names used. (:require ,,, :refer :all) or (use ,,) expressions can pull in too many other namespaces and cause issues\nA cyclic load dependency error message is a good point to review and refactor the application design.\nWhere two namespaces are interdependent on each other, factor out shared code into a third namespace required by each of the other two.  This breaks the dependency between the two original namespaces.\n\nExample - Banking on Clojure\nThe practicalli.request-handler namespace contains functions that need to access data in the database, so the practicalli.database-access namespace is required.\n(ns practicalli.request-handler\n  (:require\n   ;; Web Application\n   [ring.util.response :refer [response]]\n   [hiccup.core :refer [html]]\n   [hiccup.page :refer [html5 include-js include-css]]\n   [hiccup.element :refer [link-to]]\n\n   ;; Data access\n   [practicalli.database-access :as data-access]))\n\nThe practicalli.database-access namespace required the practicalli.specifications-banking namespace to use the specifications for generating data\n(ns practicalli.database-access\n  (:require [next.jdbc :as jdbc]\n            [next.jdbc.sql :as jdbc-sql]\n            [next.jdbc.specs :as jdbc-spec]\n\n            [practicalli.specifications-banking]))\n\nIn the practicalli.specifications-banking namespace, a functional specification had been defined for the register-account-holder function, which required the practicalli.request-handler to be required.

Simple (go), (reset) and (stop) commands are used with the REPL to control the system.\nTo assist with debugging, the parsed configuration, (config), and system configuration, (system), data can be viewed via the REPl state to understand how the configuration is being resolved.  This is especially useful when using aero and environment variables.\n Integrant REPL and IntegrantAlthough Integrant and Integrant REPL can share the same configuration file, they are otherwise separate ways of working with a system.\nIntegrant is used to start a system in a consistent order and gracefully shutdown the system on a termination message, e.g. SIGTERM.  The state of the running system in Integrant is supposed to be a hidden concern.\nIntegrant configuration\nDefine the configuration for each part of the system, such as http server (jetty, httpkit), router application (reitit, compojure, ring) and persistence storage (postgres, crux)\nCreate a develop/resources/config.edn file containing the Integrant REPL configuration (or use aero with resources/config.edn file and share the configuration with Integrant)\n{:practicalli.scoreboard.service/http-server\n {:handler #ig/ref :practicalli.scoreboard.service/router\n  :port  8888\n  :join? false}\n\n :practicalli.scoreboard.service/router\n {:persistence #ig/ref :practicalli.scoreboard.service/relational-store}\n\n :practicalli.scoreboard.service/relational-store\n {:connection  {:url \"http://localhost/\" :port 57207 :database \"scoreboard\"}}}\n\nClojure encourages fully qualified keywords, i.e. domain/key, so that keys are unique throughout the system.\nThe domain used for integrant is the Clojure namespace that contains the defmethod init-key for the key.  The Integrant load-namespaces function will automatically load all namespaces that match key names\nAero Tag Literals\nThe same configuration can be used that starts the system using profiles, or a separate develop profile can be created.\nAero uses tag literals as placeholders for environment specific values\n\n#profile - replace with the value from the given profile name\n#or  - a vector of possible values, returning the first \"truthy\" value\n#long - cast a String value to a Clojure Long type (e.g. for PORT values)\n\n{:practicalli.scoreboard.service/http-server\n {:handler #ig/ref :practicalli.scoreboard.service/router\n  :port #profile {:develop #long #or [#env APP_SERVER_PORT 8888]\n                  :test    #long #or [#env APP_SERVER_PORT 8080]\n                  :stage   #long #or [#env APP_SERVER_PORT 8080]\n                  :live    #long #or [#env APP_SERVER_PORT 8000]}\n  :join? false}\n\n :practicalli.scoreboard.service/router\n {:persistence #ig/ref :practicalli.scoreboard.service/relational-store}\n\n :practicalli.scoreboard.service/relational-store\n {:connection #profile {:develop  {:url \"http://localhost/\" :port 57207 :database \"scoreboard-develop\"}\n                        :test     {:url \"http://localhost/\" :port 57207 :database \"scoreboard-test\"}\n                        :stage    {:url \"http://localhost/\" :port 57207 :database \"scoreboard-stage\"}\n                        :live     {:url \"http://localhost/\" :port 57207 :database \"scoreboard\"}}}}\n\nUser namespace\nCommon practice is to place the Integrant REPl code in a user namespace, which is automatically loaded when the REPL process starts.\nThe user namespace is defined separately from the source code, as it is code to manage the application rather than part of the application itself.  The user namespace is added to the develop/user.clj file and added to the classpath when developing.\n(ns user\n  (:require\n   ;; REPL workflow\n   [integrant.repl       :as ig-repl]\n   [integrant.repl.state :as ig-state]\n\n   ;; Environment parsing\n   [aero.core :as aero]\n\n   ;; Utilities\n   [clojure.pprint :as pprint]))\n\nManaging the classpath\nRun a REPL process including the user namespace on the classpath.

This approach means that during development a server can be restarted to load in new code and immediately update the running application, without having to restart the REPL.\n\n Embedded servers in ClojureClojure takes a more distributed approach to deployment, starting an embedded application server within the application itself.  This approach is more conducive to the container and cloud compute infrastructure.  Scaling is achieved by running multiple instances of the application, each on its own embedded application server.In Java was common to have a single application server with all applications deployed as Jar or War archives.  This fitted with the classic architecture of deploying on a single resource rich physical hardware server.  Clojure applications can also be deployed in this classic approach if required.\nWhich Application Server to use\nThe most commonly used application servers are in the table below, with Jetty being the most common as it is wrapped by the ring library.\nJetty will be used as the defacto server in Practicalli guides, with occasional examples using other libraries.\n\n\n\nApplication Server\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEclipse Jetty\nThe original embedded Java application server most commonly used for Clojure web apps\n\n\nHttp-kit\nHigh performance Clojure/Java application server\n\n\nApache Tomcat\nClassic Java application server, very common in JVM environments\n\n\nNetty\nJava NIO asynchronous event-driven network application framework\n\n\nAleph HTTP\nClojure (Netty) Ring-compliant server with support for returning Manifold for asynchronous programming\n\n\n\nEclipse Jetty\n\nJetty is the most commonly used application server on the Java Virtual machine.\nEclipse Jetty provides a Web server and javax.servlet container, plus support for HTTP/2, WebSocket, OSGi, JMX, JNDI, JAAS and many other integrations. These components are open source and available for commercial use and distribution.\nEclipse Jetty is used in a wide variety of projects and products, both in development and production. Jetty can be easily embedded in devices, tools, frameworks, application servers, and clusters. See the Jetty Powered page for more uses of Jetty.\nThe current recommended version for use is Jetty 9\nHttp-kit\nHTTP Kit is a minimalist, efficient, Ring-compatible HTTP client/server for Clojure.\nHTTP Kit uses a event-driven architecture to support highly concurrent a/synchronous web applications. Feature a unified API for WebSocket and HTTP long polling/streaming\nThe underlying server is implemented in Java with a Clojure wrapper.\nApache Tomcat\n\nApache Tomcat is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies. The Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket specifications are developed under the Java Community Process.\nApache Tomcat software powers numerous large-scale, mission-critical web applications across a diverse range of industries and organizations, example are listed on the PoweredBy page.\nApache Tomcat, Tomcat, Apache, the Apache feather, and the Apache Tomcat project logo are trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation.\nApache Tomcat 9.0 is the current stable version with active development now on version 10.\nTomcat can be run in embedded mode, so it is not necessary to build a WAR file and deploy it in a standalone Tomcat server.\n\nCreate a Java Web Application Using Embedded Tomcat - Heroku\n\n\n\nNetty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients.\nNetty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server.\n\nAleph and Manifold\n\nManifold provides streams focused libraries, such as Aleph HTTP for web applications and TCP/UDP for more general networking.\n\n\n\n\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };

These values can either be passed as function arguments, operating system environment variables or default values.\nDefine a -main function that optionally takes an argument that will be used as a port number to listen for requests.\nA value is bound to the local name port using either the argument to the -main function, an operating system environment variable or the default port number.\n(defn -main\n  \"Start the application server on a specific port\"\n  [& [port]]\n  (let [port (Integer.

Jetty, http-kit-server.\nListen on Port\nApplication servers listen on a specific port for messages over HTTP/S which is set when starting the application server.  Public facing application will receive requests over port 80, although for security reasons a firewall or proxy is placed in front of the application server which redirects traffic to an internal port number for the application server.\nCloud application platforms (Heroku, Google, AWS) provide a port number each time a new cloud environment (eg. container) is provisioned, so an application server should read in this dynamically assigned port number from the provided operating system environment variable.\nInteger type port number\n(Integer. port-number) will cast either a string or number to a JVM integer type.  (Integer/parseInt port-number) is also commonly used and has the same result.\nThese functions are used to ensure an Integer type value is passed to the application server.  As Clojure uses Java application servers (Java app servers have decades of development) then the correct type must be passed to avoid error.\nGet environment variables\nA common way to get environment variables from the operating system is to use the Java method, System/getenv.\n(System/getenv \"PORT\") returns the value of the `PORT` environment variable.  If the variable is not set, then nil is returned (TODO: check what is actually returned)\n\n\nSystem/getProperty method will get specific values from Java .properties files, usually from a system.properties file in the root of the project.  System/getProperties will get all properties found in .properties files in the project. Settings typically found in the system.properties files include version of Java\njava.runtime.version=11\n\n\nThe Java Tutorials: Properties\n\n(System/getenv) returns a hash-map of all current environment variables.

A namespace limits the scope of functions and names of data structures to a specific namespace.\nThe names bound to function definitions using the defn function can be used elsewhere in the namespace just by using the name.  The same goes for any values bound to a name using the def function.\n Clojure order of evaluationThe code in a Clojure namespace is evaluated only once and from top to bottom.  To call a named function or data structure, it must have its definition evaluated first.\nTo use a function outside the namespace, you need to use its namespace and its name, for example clojure.string/reverse\nInclude another namespace in the REPL\nThe require function will provide access functions and names from specific namespaces and an alias for the namespace can also be specified with the :as directive.\nA function from that namespace can then be used by prefixing its name with the alias specified in the require expression.\nHere is an example of including the clojure.string namespace and calling its reverse function\n(require '[clojure.string :as string])\n\n(string/reverse \"RedRum\")\n\nIncluding another namespace in source code\nInstead of the require function, add the :require keyword in the namespace definition, ns.\n(ns todo-list.core\n (:require '[clojure.string :as string])\n\n(string/reverse \"RedRum\")\n\nIf a function will be used many times in the namespace, you can :refer a function so you can call it just by name, as if it had been defined in the current namespace.\n(ns todo-list.core\n (:require '[clojure.string :refer [reverse]]))\n\n(reverse \"RedRum\")\n\n Dependency conflicts - avoid the use functionThe use function and :use within an ns definition are seen as a bad practice and should be avoided.The use function includes all the functions as if they had been written in the  including a great many unused functions into the namespace.  It will also pull in all the other namespace functions that each namespace included.As Clojure is typically composed of many libraries, its prudent to only include the specific things you need from another namespace.  This also helps reduce conflicts when including multiple libraries in your project.\nNamespaces outside the project\nTo use a namespace from a library that is not part of the project, you also need to include it as a dependency.

When calling the run-jetty function an Integer type must be passed to the Java object for the port number.\nWhen running the Clojure project, the argument supplied for the port number on the command line is treated as a String object.  Therefore we need to explicitly cast the port number from a Java String type to an Java Integer type.\njava.lang library\nThe java.lang. library is part of all Clojure projects, so as we are going to create a Java Integer it makes sense to simply use the Integer constructor with a String argument which returns a new Integer object.\n(Integer. port-number) calls the java.lang.Integer constructor.\nThe . is actually a macro in Clojure that provides a simple way to work with Java, allowing you to call Java objects as if they were Clojure functions.

A jar file generated from Java can be run using java -jar jar-file-name.jar.  However to run your Clojure jar file as a Java application you also need to include the the Clojure core library.\nLeiningen can also generate an Uberjar.  The uberjar is a jar file that also includes the Clojure library as well as your application and libraries.  As the uberjar contains Clojure, you can run an uberjar in any Java environment.\nBy adding an :uberjar entry to the project.clj then the Leiningen command lein uberjar is run during the build and an uberjar is created.\nWhen deploying on Heroku your application is built from your codebase using Leiningen, pulling in all the libraries your application depends on.  When your application is run it is done so as a Java application using only the uberjar, starting just the one JVM.\nFurther reading: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-support\nTheory: Identifying an entry point for your application\nIf your main namespace doesn’t have a :gen-class then you can use clojure.main as your entry point and indicate your app’s main namespace using the -m argument in your Procfile:\nweb: java $JVM_OPTS -cp target/project-standalone.jar clojure.main -m myproject.web $PORT\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"projects/leiningen/todo-app/heroku/deploy.html":{"url":"projects/leiningen/todo-app/heroku/deploy.html","title":"Deploy to Heroku","keywords":"","body":"Deploy to Heroku\nFirst we need to create an Heroku app to deploy our Clojure webapp to.

So the same heading in Hiccup would be written as:\n[:h1 {:class \"heading\"} \"I am a heading\"]\n\nUsing Hiccup\nAdd the hiccup dependency to your project.clj file\n[hiccup \"1.0.5\"]\n\nIn the REPL, require the hiccup.core library\nuser=> (require '[hiccup.core :as markup])\n;; => nil\n\nOr add hiccup to the namespace definition in your Clojure code file.\n(ns my-namespace.core\n  (require '[hiccup.core :as markup]))\n\nWriting Hiccup\nHere is a basic example of Hiccup syntax:\n(markup/html [:span {:class \"foo\"} \"bar\"])\n;; => \"bar\"\n\nThe first element of the vector is used as the element name. The second attribute can optionally be a map, in which case it is used to supply the element's attributes. Every other element is considered part of the tag's body.\nHiccup is intelligent enough to render different HTML elements in different ways, in order to accommodate browser quirks:\n(markup/html [:script])\n;; => \"\"\n\n(html [:p])\n;; =>  \"\"\n\nAnd provides a CSS-like shortcut for denoting id and class attributes:\n(markup/html [:div#foo.bar.baz \"bang\"])\n;; =>  \"bang\"\n\nWhen writing multiple lines of hiccup markup, wrap them in either a [:div ] or a (list ) expression.\n[:div\n  [:h1 \"My Picture Album\"]\n  [:img {:src seaside.png} \"A sunny seaside view\"]\n  [:img {:src pier.png} \"A walk along the pier\"]]\n\nIf the body of the element is a seq, its contents will be expanded out into the element body. This makes working with forms like map and for more convenient:\n(html [:ul\n  (for [x (range 1 4)]\n    [:li x])])\n;; => \"123\"\n\n(html\n  [:ul\n  (for [x (range 1 4)]\n    [:li x])])\n;; => \"123\"\n\nThe parent tag will still be rendered in the above example, so\n  Hiccup reference and guides\nHiccup API\nHiccup Tips - Lisp Cast\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"projects/leiningen/todo-app/hiccup/updating-handlers-with-hiccup.html":{"url":"projects/leiningen/todo-app/hiccup/updating-handlers-with-hiccup.html","title":"Updating handlers with hiccup","keywords":"","body":"Updating handlers with hiccup\nInstead of including fiddly html code (and having to make sure you close tags), we will write our markup in Clojure syntax using hiccup.\nAdd dependencies\n  Add hiccup dependencies\n[hiccup \"1.0.5\"]\n\nRequire hiccup\n  Add hiccup to your namespace\n[hiccup.core :refer :all]\n[hiccup.page :refer :all]\n\nYour core.clj file should look like this\n(ns todo-list.core\n  (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]\n            [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]\n            [compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET]]\n            [compojure.route :refer [not-found]]\n            [ring.handler.dump :refer [handle-dump]]\n            [hiccup.core :refer :all]\n            [hiccup.page :refer :all]))\n\nUpdate the welcome handler\n  Change the welcome handler to use hiccup rather than html code\n(defn welcome\n  \"A ring handler to respond with a simple welcome message\"\n  [request]\n  (html [:h1 \"Hello, Clojure World\"]\n        [:p \"Welcome to your first Clojure app, I now update automatically\"]))\n\nThe html function create html code based on the keywords used.
