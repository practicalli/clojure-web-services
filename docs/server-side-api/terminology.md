## Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules,[1] but also maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme (e.g. "http://").
