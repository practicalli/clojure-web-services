# The code so far

  The code and configuration we have created so far are in the [clojure-todo-list-example repository](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-todo-list-example) github repository.

  Code for this section is in the branch called `master`

  If something is not working or you want to speed up, simply clone the project into a new directory using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-todo-list-example
```
Once you have cloned the project, checkout the `master` branch

```bash
git checkout master
```
