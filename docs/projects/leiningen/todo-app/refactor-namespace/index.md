# Refactor Core Namespace

The `todo-list.core` namespace is getting quite full and only going to get more code, unless we refactor the design and create some additional namespaces.

A namespace is a way to group behaviour (functions) and data (data structures / defs) in one scope.  Functions can be defined as private to that scope, so only other functions in the same namespace can call them.
