# Naming - local scope


## Local names in functions
  You can define names for things within the scope of a function using the `let` function.
  
    
### Example


## Local names in data structures 

  When defining a map you are creating a series of key value pairs.  The key is essentially a name that represents the value it is paired with.  Keys are often defined using a `:keyword`.
  
```clojure  
  {:radius 10, :pi 22/7 :colour purple}
  
  (def my-circle {:radius 10, :pi 22/7 :colour purple})
```
