# Other Development tools for Clojure 

Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine so its not surprising that there is good support for Clojure in the major Java IDEs.

## InteliJ

![Cursive Clojure](../images/cursive-clojure-logo.png)

[Cursive](https://cursiveclojure.com/) is a Clojure IDE that aims to understands your code.  Advanced structural editing, refactorings, VCS integration and much more, all out of the box.  It is currently a standalone tool, although will eventually become an IntelliJ plugin.

[La Clojure](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4050) is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.  Provides Clojure language support: syntax and error highlighting, completion, navigation and refactorings.

## Netbeans 

Netbeans did have great support for Clojure, but unfortunately at the time of writing the Clojure plugin has been unmaintained for so long it is not a viable tool to use for Cojure development.
