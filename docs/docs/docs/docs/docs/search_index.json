guide to developing server-side web applications and API's from the ground up using Clojure, aiming for a simple and clean design using functional programming concepts. Libraries are used to provide common features and alternative libraries are discussed.\nRelevant theory and background reading is included, however, the focus of this guide is for you to build projects and experiment.\nClojure CLI and deps.edn\nProjects are created and configure using Clojure CLI tools, using deps.edn for configuration.  Older content uses Leinigen for project configuration.\nComponent / library approach\nThe Clojure community has a diverse set of libraries which focus on a specific need. These libraries are assembled to rapidly develop a tailored solution.  Using a library approach means those libraries are relatively simple to replace with alternatives or your own libraries.\nProject templates are used to create projects that include commonly used libraries, along with example code, demonstrating how common services can be assembled. Templates have options to configure the project as its created, customising to the specific needs of the problem being solved.\nClojure does not focus on the classic framework approach like Rails or Spring, for a very good reason. Frameworks are design decisions others have made without knowing the context of the current problem at hand, so there is no guarantee on how many of those decisions are relevant. Frameworks tend to include many features not relevant to the current problem. Frameworks can be over relied upon, taking away an opportunity to think about the most relevant solution.\n\n Book refresh in 2020The guides are to be updated to use Clojure CLI and tools.deps for project configuration and depenedency management.\nSee Clojure web server from scratch\nand Practicalli Clojure WebApps playlist whilst this content is being updated.\nDiscussions and feedback\n\nGet a free Clojurians slack community account\nCreative commons license\nPracticalli Clojure WebApps by Practicalli Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"content-plan.html":{"url":"content-plan.html","title":"Content Plan","keywords":"","body":"Content plan for Clojure WebApps book\nThanks to the support from Clojurists Together the Clojure WebApps book is being updated to add more content and cover more libraries.\nContent will also move to using Clojure CLI tools and deps.edn projects, although the Leiningen content will remain available.\nProposed content topics for the book update\n\n\n\nTopics\nRelated projects and implementations\n\n\n\n\nFundamentals\nring and compojure based web applications, covering routing, handlers, middleware, etc.\n\n\nBuilding API's\ncompojure-api template, openapi (swagger), prismatic schema, transit, jsonista\n\n\nConsuming API's\nclojure.data.* , edn, transit, jsonista\n\n\nHTML content and templates\nHiccup and Selmer\n\n\nWeb Scraping\nEnilve and clojure.data.*\n\n\nFull Stack apps\nLuminus template, ClojureScript UI,\n\n\nData access\njdbc.next, migrations,\n\n\nWebSockets\n\n\n\nHigh Performance\nhttp-kit\n\n\nAlternative libraries\nYada, Bidi, Reitit\n\n\nComponent Lifecycle\nmount, component, integrant, roll your own\n\n\nData Oriented service design\nReitit, Duct, Edge\n\n\nUI design and styling\nCSS libraries (bulma, bootstrap, foundation), SVG graphics\n\n\n\nProject ideas\nIdeas for projects to implement are most welcome\n\nDependency graph using SVG graphics\nTODO / Kanban application\nStatus monitor (SVG Graphics)\nUser Management website (demonstrating how to make this usable for other projects)\nContent API for video (targeted searching for finding very specific content on YouTube)\nFinancial services API's - online banking, personal insurance, stock tracking (mock stocks)\nAPI's for a mobile application - Scoreboards, chat boards, rewards, profiles, evil chat bots\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"requirements.html":{"url":"requirements.html","title":"Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Requirements\n  2020 refreshThis guide will be updated use Clojure CLI tools and tools.deps.

This is the essence of how a function works in Clojure.  So its really simple to design web apps with Clojure.\nAs Clojure is centered around dynamic types and immutable data structures, it makes web applications really easy to build and simple to scale through parallelism.  The majority of your application will be stateless, therefore will be less complex and less prone to conflicts.\nLibraries over frameworks\nClojure also takes a very modular approach to building any application and has many great libraries to minimise the work involved.  As Java Interoperability is also very easy in Clojure, its trivial to use Java libraries too.\nWeb apps in Clojure are typically built from a collection of highly focused libraries.  Each library has a specific focus and enables a modular approach, as you can swap components & libraries easily should there be value in a different approach.\nCommon libraries for web app development include:\n\nRing - a web application library\nCompojure - an simple way to define routes for your ring webapp\nHiccup or Selmer- to generate HTML from Clojure data structures\njdbc.next - a modern low-level Clojure wrapper for JDBC access to databases\nclojure.java.jdbc - simple low level SQL library\nKorma, YesQL, hugSql - database abstraction layers\nPrismatic Schema - database schema mapping\nMigratus - database migrations (and all the things)\n\nThe closed thing to a framework in Clojure is Pedestal.  Frameworks constrain you to a certain approach to building apps and if you can live inside these constraints they can be very powerful.\nProject templates\nYou don't have to build projects from scratch each time, although this is a valid approach.  There are many great Clojure project templates available via the build automation tool, Leiningen\nProject templates are used as follows\nlein new template-name project-name\n\nThere are many great templates to try that provide insight into building webapps in Clojure.\n\ncompojure - a common web application approach with ring and compojure\ncompojure-api - quickly build API's with ring, compojure and openapi (swagger) for self-documentation\nluminus - a flexible template to create server-side and full stack web applications\npedestal-service - an opinionated, extensible & scalable framework\nduct - data-oriented production-grade server-side web applications\nJUXT Edge - a curated base project to build your own applications and services\n\nYou can find a range of project templates by searching for lein-template on Clojars.org.

In a command line terminal, issue the login command which opens a web browser to login to Heroku.

Heroku therefore considers the application as unresponsive and sets it status to crashed, tearing down the container the application is running in.\nThese logs were generated before adding the $PORT to the command in the Procfile.\n\nNo forced pushes\nHeroku doesnt like force Git pushes coming via CircleCI.\n\nTo get around this, either dont do force pushes to GitHub, or add the Heroku repositor for the project as a remote to local git repository.\nHeroku repository details in heroku dashboard Settings under App Information\nChanges can now be pushed, ideally using force-with-lease to Heroku repository.\ngit push heroku live:master\n\nHeroku only builds from a branch called master, so the above command pushes the local live branch to the remote master branch on Heroku.\n\nStopping the application\nAn application can be run for free on Heroku with the monthly free credits provided.

Heroku automatically asignes a port number for an application to listen upon when creating a contain in which the application will run.  This port number is set using the PORT environment variable and is available to the application on startup.  Using the PORT environment variable ensures the Clojure application will recieve requests.\nweb: java -jar banking-on-clojure.jar $PORT\n\nSpecifying a Java version\nCreate a system.properties and specify the Java version to use for the application. Java 1.8 is the default version use on Heroku, however, our development environment is Java 11, so add a property to set the Java runtime to version 11.\njava.runtime.version=11\n\nCircleCI Environment Variables\nOpen the CircleCI and select project settings > Environment Variables\nAdd environment variables to define where the Heroku application can be found and a token to provide access.\n\n\n\nEnvironment Variable\nValue\n\n\n\n\nHEROKU_API_KEY\nname of the application created on Heroku\n\n\nHEROKU_APP_NAME\nAPI key found in Account Settings > API Key\n\n\n\nHeroku Pipeline configuration\nLogin to the Heroku dashboard and create a new pipeline called banking-on-clojure-webapp\nIn the Heroku dashboard, open the application Settings and add a Config Vars using the name CLOJURE_CLI_VERSION with a value of 1.10.1.727\n\nUsing Heroku Pipelines the staging environment is promoted to production rather than being rebuilt\n\nThe Heroku dashboard can be used to promote the application into production, once the staging application is signed off.\n\nPush changes to trigger build\nCommit the changed and push them to the GitHub repository.  This triggers a build by CircleCI.  The build downloads the dependencies and runs the unit tests.  If the tests pass, then the Heroku deploy workflow starts.\nThe two stages can be seen in the dashboard as the pipeline runs.\n\nNow visit the deployed Heroku application to see it in action.\nTroubleshooting\nIf there are issues, then use the Heroku toolbelt to look at the logs.  In a command line terminal, issue the login command which opens a web browser to login to Heroku.  Once logged in, run the heroku logs command to view the latest logs\nheroku login\n\nheroku logs --app banking-on-clojure\n\nThe logs can also be viewed live, as the application is being deployed by including the --tail option when running the heroku logs command in a terminal\nheroku logs --app banking-on-clojure --tail\n\nThe example Heroku logs show that the banking-on-clojure is using the default port number if non is supplied as an argument, rather than Heroku assigned port.  Heroku therefore considers the application as unresponsive and sets it status to crashed, tearing down the container the application is running in.\nThese logs were generated before adding the $PORT to the command in the Procfile.\n\nNo forced pushes\nHeroku doesnt like force Git pushes coming via CircleCI.\n\nTo get around this, either dont do force pushes to GitHub, or add the Heroku repositor for the project as a remote to local git repository.\nHeroku repository details in heroku dashboard Settings under App Information\nChanges can now be pushed, ideally using force-with-lease to Heroku repository.\ngit push heroku live:master\n\n\nHeroku only builds from a branch called master, so the above command pushes the local live branch to the remote master branch on Heroku.\n\nStopping the application\nAn application can be run for free on Heroku with the monthly free credits provided.  However, to make the most out of these free credits then applications not in use should be shut down\nRun the following command in the root of the Clojure project.\nheroku ps:stop banking-on-clojure\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"projects/banking-on-clojure/unit-tests.html":{"url":"projects/banking-on-clojure/unit-tests.html","title":"Unit Tests","keywords":"","body":"Unit tests\nIn Clojure web applications the handler functions are the main focus of the unit tests.\nCreate the file test/practicalli/request-handler-test.clj to contain the unit tests.\nDefine the request-handler-test namespace, including other namespaces that should be required.\nThe ring.mock.request library is added to simulate request calls to the handlers.\n(ns practicalli.request-handler-test\n  (:require [practicalli.request-handler :as SUT]\n            [clojure.test :refer [deftest is testing]]\n            [ring.mock.request :as mock]))\n\nAdd unit tests for each handler that will be created in practicalli.request-handler.\nA simple starting point for tests is to check the correct HTTP status code is being returned.\nring.mock.request library contains a request function that will generate a mock request hash-map from a given HTTP protocol (:get :post etc.) and a address.\n(deftest welcome-page-test\n  (testing \"Testing elements on the welcome page\"\n    (is (= 200\n           (:status (SUT/welcome-page (mock/request :get \"/\")))))))\n\nEnsuring a status code in handlers\nThe ring.util.response namespace is added to the practicalli.request-handlers namespace.

Each account has an account holder, a current balance and a date of when the current balance was last updated.\ntransaction_history contains every transaction that takes place in the bank.  Each transaction is related to a specific account.  The current balance for an account is built from all the transactions for a specific account.  The number of transactions used to calculate the current balance is reduced by using the last_updated value from accounts.\n\nOrganising the code\nThe SQL statements that create the database tables will be bound to a suitable name using def.  The value will be a vector containing the string of the SQL statement.\nThe SQL statements are generated by the DBever database managment tool.  The tables are created in DBeaver and the DDL script is exported for each table and pasted in the Clojure code.\nA create-tables helper function executes the given SQL statements on a specific data source, from within a transaction so that all table are either created or none are created.\ndb-specification-dev is a name bound to the database specification map for the development database.  This should eventually end up as an aero configuration along with the production database specification.\n(def db-specification-dev {:dbtype \"h2\" :dbname \"banking-on-clojure\"})\n\nDefine ACCOUNT-HOLDERS table\nDefine the SQL statement to create a table to hold all the ACCOUNT-HOLDERS.\nThe design includes all the customer details plus from the Banking on Clojure specifications and the account_holder_id that uniquely identifies the customer.\n(def schema-account-holders-table\n  [\"CREATE TABLE PUBLIC.ACCOUNT_HOLDERS(\n     ACCOUNT_HOLDER_ID UUID(16) NOT NULL,\n     FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(32),\n     LAST_NAME VARCHAR(32),\n     EMAIL_ADDRESS VARCHAR(32),\n     RESIDENTIAL_ADDRESS VARCHAR(255),\n     SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER VARCHAR(32),\n     CONSTRAINT CONSTRAINT_3 PRIMARY KEY (ACCOUNT_HOLDER_ID))\"])\n\n\nUsing random data, like uuid, for indexes can be inefficient especially for larger data sets.  There may be data types for each specific database that provide more efficient ways of managing unique ids.  For the scope of this project, using a UUID is acceptable.\n\nDefine ACCOUNTS table\nDefine the SQL statement to create the ACCOUNTS\nEach account is associated with an ACCOUNT_HOLDER_ID so that all the accounts belonging to a customer can be easily found.\nThe current balance holds the value of credit in an account at the time of the last updated date.  The current_balance is calculated from the values in the transaction_history and updates to the current_balance will update the last_updated value.  This provides a very simplistic mechanism for quickly presenting the value of an account.\n(def schema-accounts-table\n  [\"CREATE TABLE PUBLIC.ACCOUNTS(\n     ACCOUNT_ID UUID(16) NOT NULL,\n     ACCOUNT_NUMBER INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n     ACCOUNT_SORT_CODE VARCHAR(6),\n     ACCOUNT_NAME VARCHAR(32),\n     CURRENT_BALANCE VARCHAR(255),\n     LAST_UPDATED DATE,\n     ACCOUNT_HOLDER_ID VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n     CONSTRAINT ACCOUNTS_PK PRIMARY KEY (ACCOUNT_ID))\"] )\n\nDefine TRANSACTION_HISTORY table\nDefine the SQL statement to create the ACCOUNTS\nAll transactions include a value of the transaction, a reference to explain the purpose of the transaction, a date the transaction occured, the account the transaction comes from and the account the transaction goes to.\n(def schema-transaction-history-table\n  [\"CREATE TABLE PUBLIC.TRANSACTION_HISTORY(\n     TRANSACTION_ID UUID(16) NOT NULL,\n     TRANSACTION_VALUE INTEGER NOT NULL,\n     TRANSACTION_REFERENCE VARCHAR(32),\n     TRANSACTION_DATE DATE,\n     ACCOUNT_FROM INTEGER,\n     ACCOUNT_TO INTEGER,\n     CONSTRAINT TRANSACTION_HISTORY_PK PRIMARY KEY (TRANSACTION_ID))\"])\n\n Constraint NamingConstraints are used to add Primary Keys to database tables.  Each constraint needs an identifier which is included in error reporting when there are issues.  It is recommended to use meaningful names for identifiers to trace the source of errors and also support maintenance of the overall database design.\nExecute Table schema in the development database\nDefine a function to use the table creation SQL statements and execute them on the given database.\nThe function uses with-open to create and manage a connection, closing that connection when the function has completed.\n(defn create-table\n  \"Establish a connection to the data source and create a table within a transaction.\n  Close the database connection.\n  Arguments:\n  - table-schemas: a vector containing an sql statements to create a table\"\n  [table-schema data-spec]\n\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection data-spec)]\n    (jdbc/execute! connection  table-schemas)))\n\n with-open - managing resourceswith-open ensures that resources get closed and clearly defines the scope of the using the resource.This helps the developer avoid using Clojure’s lazy sequences in a with-open block.  Within the scope of the with-open expression it is important to make sure that the result is eagerly evaluated to avoid accessing the resource after it’s closed, or fall foul of the \"ResultSet closed\" or \"transaction closed\" errors.\nRefactor the function to execute all the SQL statements in a transaction, so either all the databases are created or none are.\nUsing transactions can help prevent databases becoming in an inconsistent state due to only partial completion of a set of SQL statements.\n(defn create-tables\n  \"Establish a connection to the data source and create all tables within a transaction.\n  Close the database connection.\n  Arguments:\n  - table-schemas: a vector of sql statements, each creating a table\"\n  [table-schemas data-spec]\n\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection data-spec)]\n    (jdbc/with-transaction [transaction connection]\n      (doseq [sql-statement table-schemas]\n        (jdbc/execute! transaction sql-statement) ))))\n\n Refactor for connection poolswith-open function can be removed from the create-tables function when using a connection pool, passing the existing connection from the pool to the jdbc/with-transaction function.\nCalling the create-tables function will create the database tables in the development database.\nThe H2 database writes the tables to disk in the banking-on-clojure.mv.db file.  Unless the table is dropped, there is no need to evaluate this function again.\nViewing tables in the database\n(defn information-tables\n  [data-source]\n  (jdbc/execute!\n    data-source\n    [\"select * from information_schema.tables\"])\n\nCreate a helper function to show the schema of any particular table.

The function is then usable for development, staging and production data sources (although its not generally advisable to update production database from a REPL in the development environment once its live)\n(defn show-schema\n  [data-source table-name]\n  (jdbc/execute! data-source [(str \"show columns from \" table-name)]))\n\nThe connection is not manged though, so refactor again and add the with-open command to ensure the connection is closed once the funcition has finished.\n(defn show-schema\n  [db-spec table-name]\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection db-spec)]\n    (jdbc/execute! connection [(str \"SHOW COLUMNS FROM \" table-name)])))\n\nRemoving (dropping) database tables\nA helper function for removing tables from the database, dropping the data and the schema of the table.\ndrop-table function only differs from the show-schema function in the specific SQL statement it uses.\n(defn drop-table\n  [db-spec table-name]\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-datasource db-spec)]\n    (jdbc/execute! connection [(str \"DROP TABLE \" table-name)])))\n\n\nA generic helper function could be used if the SQL statement were also an argument.\n\nManaging database tables from the REPL\nWhen designing the database schema it can be useful to iterate quickly around the design.  Using a Rich Comment Block to hold expressions to create show and drop tables is an effective way to manage the database schema quickly.\n(comment  ;; Managing Schemas\n\n  ;; Create all tables in the development database\n  (create-tables [schema-account-holders-table schema-accounts-table schema-transaction-history-table]\n                 db-specification-dev)\n\n  ;; View application table schema in development database\n  (show-schema data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.ACCOUNT_HOLDERS\")\n  (show-schema data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.ACCOUNTS\")\n  (show-schema data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.TRANSACTION_HISTORY\")\n\n  ;; View database system schema in development database\n  (show-schema data-source-dev \"INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES\")\n\n  ;; Remove tables from the development database\n  (drop-table data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.ACCOUNT_HOLDERS\")\n  (drop-table data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.ACCOUNTS\")\n  (drop-table data-source-dev \"PUBLIC.TRANSACTION_HISTORY\")\n\n  )\n\n  Manage database schema with MigratusMigratus provides an elegant approach to evolving database schema\n\n Common errorsSyntax error in SQL statement can occur if the SQL statement is not correct, the most common cause is a missing comma.Databases do not always support exactly the same SQL syntax, especially around types and more advanced features.

The options are similar for update and delete queries.\nAll options use the with-open function to wrap the connection to the database, to automatically close that connection once the function has completed.\n\n\n\nApproach\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnext.jdbc/execute! function\nSimple approached used previously for creating tables\n\n\nDefining a generic function\nPass SQL statements and connection into a single function, using def to define sql statements\n\n\nnext.jdbc.sql/* functions\nGenerate SQL statements from Clojure data structures, e.g. hash-maps, vectors, etc.\n\n\nGeneric function with next.jdbc.sql/* functions\nGeneric insert, update and delete functions that take a Clojure data structures\n\n\n\nExample SQL queries from DBeaver\nUsing the DBeaver tool the basic form of an insert command is generated from ... insert DDL\nINSERT INTO PUBLIC.ACCOUNT_HOLDERS\n (ACCOUNT_HOLDER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL_ADDRESS, RESIDENTIAL_ADDRESS, SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER)\nVALUES(?, '', '', '', '', '');\n\nUsing the general execute! command\nUsing the general jdbc/execute! is the same form as used previously to create, show and drop database tables.\n(defn persist-account-holder\n  \"Persist a new account holder record\"\n  [account-holder-id db-spec]\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection db-spec)]\n    (jdbc/execute!\n      connection\n      [(str \"insert into account_holders(\n               account_holder_id,first_name,last_name,email_address,residential_address,social_security_number)\n             values(\n               '\" account-holder-id \"', 'Jenny', 'Jetpack', 'jen@jetpack.org', '42 Meaning Lane, Altar IV', 'AB101112C' )\")])) )\n\nCall the function with a randomly generated UUID value for the account_holder_id and the database details in the form of the development database specification.\n(persist-account-holder (java.util.UUID/randomUUID) db-specification-dev)\n\nUsing a generic function approach\nWrite a Clojure function that takes in any SQL statement and executes that against a specific database specification.\n(defn database-update\n  [sql-statement db-spec ]\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection db-spec)]\n    (jdbc/execute! connection sql-statement)))\n\nRefactor sql statements into their own vars, so they can be reused.\n(def account-holder-jenny\n  [(str \"insert into account_holders(account_holder_id,first_name,last_name,email_address,residential_address,social_security_number)\n    values('\" (java.util.UUID/randomUUID) \"', 'Jenny', 'Jetpack', 'jen@jetpack.org', '42 Meaning Lane, Altar IV', 'AB101112C' )\")])\n\nUpdate the database using the name of the SQL statement\n(database-update account-holder-jenny db-specification-dev)\n\n\nThe limitation of this approach is that the def expression must be evaluated each time a new value for the account_holder_id is required.  The first time the def is evaluated, the java-util.UUID/randomUUID function is evaluated to a specific value and that value is cached.  Using the account-holder-jenny name in other code will use the cache until the def expression is forcefully evaluated (by the developer or by restarting the REPL).\n\nUsing next.jdbc friendly functions\nUsing next.jdbc.sql functions.  For example:\n(jdbc-sql/insert! ds :address {:name \"A. Person\" :email \"albert@person.org\"})\n\nFor the banking-on-clojure project this would take the form\n(defn add-account-holder\n  [account-holder-id data-source]\n  (jdbc-sql/insert!\n    data-source\n    :table-name {:column-name \"value\" ,,,}))\n\nIn this example, the next.jdbc insert! function is used to add an account holder record.\n(defn add-account-holder\n  [account-holder-id db-spec]\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection db-spec)]\n    (jdbc-sql/insert!\n      connection\n      :public.account_holders {:account_holder_id      account-holder-id\n                               :first_name             \"Rachel\"\n                               :last_name              \"Rocketpack\"\n                               :email_address          \"rach@rocketpack.org\"\n                               :residential_address    \"1 Ultimate Question Lane, Altar IV\"\n                               :social_security_number \"BB104312D\"})))\n\nCalling the function with generated data.\n(add-account-holder (java.util.UUID/randomUUID) db-specification-dev)\n\nGeneric insert function with next.jdbc.sql\n(defn insert-record\n  [table record-data db-spec]\n  (with-open [connection (jdbc/get-connection db-spec)]\n    (jdbc-sql/insert! connection table record-data)))\n\nThe data to pass in looks familiar. Its the table name plus a data structure that looks like a specification for an account holder.\n:public.account_holders\n\n{:account_holder_id      (java.util.UUID/randomUUID)\n :first_name             \"Rachel\"\n :last_name              \"Rocketpack\"\n :email_address          \"rach@rocketpack.org\"\n :residential_address    \"1 Ultimate Question Lane, Altar IV\"\n :social_security_number \"BB104312D\"}\n\nSo the specifications already defined can be used to generate mock data for the database.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"projects/banking-on-clojure/create-records.html":{"url":"projects/banking-on-clojure/create-records.html","title":"Create Records","keywords":"","body":"Create database records\nSeveral options were explored when designing database query functions.

When there are cyclic namespace dependencies a warning is returned when evaluating any of the namespaces involved.\nA good way to spot cyclic load dependencies it to regularly run a test runner on the code, or even set up a test runner to watch for changes to the file system which then triggers an automatic test run.  For example, kaocha --watch.\nTips on avoiding  cyclic load dependencies\n\nAdd comment sections describing the purpose of the different parts of code, creating logical separation of code.  Refactor of namespaces is far easier to see and helps ensure related code is kept together.\nEnsure test and specification code is in its own namespace.  Keeping the right level of abstraction in tests and clojure spec test.check can help avoid issues.\nUse require to add dependent namespaces, preferably using a meaningful :as alias or using :refer for only the function names used.

Feedback welcome.\nStart and restart services quickly and easily from within the REPL with Integrant REPL.\nIntegrant REPL is for developing a system using a reloaded REPL workflow and is a separate Library and intent to that of Integrant, which is aimed at the lifecycle of running a system.\nReloaded REPL provides a simple way to reload changes into the system as it is being developed. Simple (go), (reset) and (stop) commands are used with the REPL to control the system.\nTo assist with debugging, the parsed configuration, (config), and system configuration, (system), data can be viewed via the REPl state to understand how the configuration is being resolved.  This is especially useful when using aero and environment variables.\n Integrant REPL and IntegrantAlthough Integrant and Integrant REPL can share the same configuration file, they are otherwise separate ways of working with a system.\nIntegrant is used to start a system in a consistent order and gracefully shutdown the system on a termination message, e.g. SIGTERM.  The state of the running system in Integrant is supposed to be a hidden concern.\n fs\nIntegrant configuration\nDefine the configuration for each part of the system, such as http server (jetty, httpkit), router application (reitit, compojure, ring) and persistence storage (postgres, crux)\nCreate a develop/resources/config.edn file containing the Integrant REPL configuration (or use aero with resources/config.edn file and share the configuration with Integrant)\n{:practicalli.scoreboard.service/http-server\n {:handler #ig/ref :practicalli.scoreboard.service/router\n  :port  8888\n  :join? false}\n\n :practicalli.scoreboard.service/router\n {:persistence #ig/ref :practicalli.scoreboard.service/relational-store}\n\n :practicalli.scoreboard.service/relational-store\n {:connection  {:url \"http://localhost/\" :port 57207 :database \"scoreboard\"}}}\n\nClojure encourages fully qualified keywords, i.e. domain/key, so that keys are unique throughout the system.\nThe domain used for integrant is the Clojure namespace that contains the defmethod init-key for the key.  The Integrant load-namespaces function will automatically load all namespaces that match key names\nAero Tag Literals\nThe same configuration can be used that starts the system using profiles, or a separate develop profile can be created.\nAero uses tag literals as placeholders for environment specific values\n\n#profile - replace with the value from the given profile name\n#or  - a vector of possible values, returning the first \"truthy\" value\n#long - cast a String value to a Clojure Long type (e.g. for PORT values)\n\n{:practicalli.scoreboard.service/http-server\n {:handler #ig/ref :practicalli.scoreboard.service/router\n  :port #profile {:develop #long #or [#env APP_SERVER_PORT 8888]\n                  :test    #long #or [#env APP_SERVER_PORT 8080]\n                  :stage   #long #or [#env APP_SERVER_PORT 8080]\n                  :live    #long #or [#env APP_SERVER_PORT 8000]}\n  :join? false}\n\n :practicalli.scoreboard.service/router\n {:persistence #ig/ref :practicalli.scoreboard.service/relational-store}\n\n :practicalli.scoreboard.service/relational-store\n {:connection #profile {:develop  {:url \"http://localhost/\" :port 57207 :database \"scoreboard-develop\"}\n                        :test     {:url \"http://localhost/\" :port 57207 :database \"scoreboard-test\"}\n                        :stage    {:url \"http://localhost/\" :port 57207 :database \"scoreboard-stage\"}\n                        :live     {:url \"http://localhost/\" :port 57207 :database \"scoreboard\"}}}}\n\nUser namespace\nCommon practice is to place the Integrant REPl code in a user namespace, which is automatically loaded when the REPL process starts.\nThe user namespace is defined separately from the source code, as it is code to manage the application rather than part of the application itself.  The user namespace is added to the develop/user.clj file and added to the classpath when developing.\n(ns user\n  (:require\n   ;; REPL workflow\n   [integrant.repl       :as ig-repl]\n   [integrant.repl.state :as ig-state]\n\n   ;; Environment parsing\n   [aero.core :as aero]\n\n   ;; Utilities\n   [clojure.pprint :as pprint]))\n\nManaging the classpath\nRun a REPL process including the user namespace on the classpath.

In a multi-threaded application then multiple connections to the database may be created.  If multiple instances of an application are deployed, then multiple database connections will be created.\nAs the number of simultaneous connections to the database grows, the more need for a connection pool service to maximize the performance of the database.\nPostgreSQL\nWhen a client connects to PostgreSQL database the parent process spawns a worker process which listens to the newly created connection. Spawning a work process each time can support a small number of database connections. As the number of simultaneous connections increases, CPU and memory resources also increase.\nWithout a connection pool a new database connection is created for each client.\n\n Limits via PostgreSQL configurationThe max_connections configuration for PostgreSQL limits the number of client connections allowed, so additional connections are refused or dropped.\nConnection pool with PostgreSQL\nA connection pool shares a fixed set of recyclable connections which can manage a large numbers of simultaneous connections due to the reduced CPU and memory usage.\nThe fixed set of connections is called the pool size and it is recommended to test the size of the pool used during integration tests.\nA connection pool can efficiently deal with idle or stagnant client connections, as well as queue up client requests during traffic spikes instead of rejecting them.\n\nConnection pool implementations\nA connection pool can be implemented either on the application side or as middleware between the database and your application.\n\npgBouncer - a lightweight, open-source middleware connection pool for PostgreSQL.\nHikariCP - Fast, simple, reliable.

A namespace limits the scope of functions and names of data structures to a specific namespace.\nThe names bound to function definitions using the defn function can be used elsewhere in the namespace just by using the name.  The same goes for any values bound to a name using the def function.\n Clojure order of evaluationThe code in a Clojure namespace is evaluated only once and from top to bottom.  To call a named function or data structure, it must have its definition evaluated first.\nTo use a function outside the namespace, you need to use its namespace and its name, for example clojure.string/reverse\nInclude another namespace in the REPL\nThe require function will provide access functions and names from specific namespaces and an alias for the namespace can also be specified with the :as directive.\nA function from that namespace can then be used by prefixing its name with the alias specified in the require expression.\nHere is an example of including the clojure.string namespace and calling its reverse function\n(require '[clojure.string :as string])\n\n(string/reverse \"RedRum\")\n\nIncluding another namespace in source code\nInstead of the require function, add the :require keyword in the namespace definition, ns.\n(ns todo-list.core\n (:require '[clojure.string :as string])\n\n(string/reverse \"RedRum\")\n\nIf a funciton will be used many times in the namespace, you can :refer a function so you can call it just by name, as if it had been defined in the current namespace.\n(ns todo-list.core\n (:require '[clojure.string :refer [reverse]]))\n\n(reverse \"RedRum\")\n\n Dependency conflicts - avoid the use functionThe use function and :use within an ns definition are seen as a bad practice and should be avoided.The use function includes all the functions as if they had been written in the  including a great many unused functions into the namespace.  It will also pull in all the other namespace functions that each namespace included.As Clojure is typically composed of many libraries, its prudent to only include the specific things you need from another namespace.  This also helps reduce conflicts when including multiple libraries in your project.\nNamespaces outside the project\nTo use a namespace from a library that is not part of the project, you also need to include it as a dependency.

The -main function contains an anonymous function that takes any request and returns a response map.\nThe -main function takes a port number as an argument which we pass when running the application.\n\nA response map contains the following key / value pairs\n\n:status - the result of the request, eg. 200 OK, 401 Not Found, etc\n:body - the content to be returned (web page, json, etc)\n:headers - a map of standard headers included in any web browser response\n\n   Add a function called -main to the  src/todo_list/core.clj file.Edit the src/todo_list/core.clj file and add the following function, after the namespace definition.(defn -main\n  \"A very simple web server using Ring & Jetty\"\n  [port-number]\n  (webserver/run-jetty\n    (fn [request]\n      {:status  200\n       :headers {}\n       :body    \"Hello, Clojure World\n                 Welcome to your first Clojure app.\n                 This message is returned regardless of the request, sorry\"})\n    {:port  (Integer. port-number)\n     :join? false}))\n\nExplaining the new function\nUsing a - at the start of the -main function is a naming convention, helping you see which function is the entry point to your program.  Leiningen also looks for this -main function by default when running your application.\nThe webserver/run-jetty function takes two arguments.  In our example, the first argument is an anonymous function that returns a map (the response to the browser request);  the second argument is a port number to run the jetty server on expressed as a Java Integer object.\nThe Integer. function is a call to java.lang.Integer.  The . is a special form that tells Clojure to treat this name as a call to Java.

However you do not need to specify any specific types as Clojure simply infers the type and handles most type collision gracefully.  The built in collections (list, map, vector & set) also support mixed types too.\nIn our project we are using Jetty, a web application server written in Java.  As its Java it needs a specific type of object passed as an argument for the port number, in this case an Integer.  However, when we run the Clojure project, the argument we supply for the port number on the command line is treated as a String object.  Therefore we need to change the port number from a Java String type to an Java Integer type.\nThe java.lang. library is part of all Clojure projects, so as we are going to create a Java Integer it makes sense to simply use the Integer constructor with a String argument which returns a new Integer object.\nThe Integer. port-number Clojure code is a short-hand for calling the java.lang.Integer constructor.  The . is actually a macro in Clojure that provides a simple way to work with Java, allowing you to call Java objects as if they were Clojure functions.  In Java you would have to use the form Type instance-name = new Type(argument).  In our example you would write this in Java as String port = new String(port-number)\n   From the Java 8 docs for Integer class:Integer(String s) - constructs a newly allocated Integer object that represents the int value indicated by the String parameter.\nTheory: Its Java Objects underneath strings & numbers\nStrings and numbers are represented by Java objects underneath, so its convienient to use Java Classes to manipulate these simple data structures on the rare occasion you need a specific type.\nYou can see the underlying Java types in Clojure using the type or class function.

One JVM is to run Leiningen and the second JVM is to run your application.  By using Leiningen to run your application in production you are using use extra resources and also risk pulling in unnecessary development libraries & configuration only needed during development.\nWhen you run your application in production you can save resources by only running a JVM for your application.  This is done by running a Clojure application just like a Java application, using the java command in the Heroku Procfile.\nTheory: Building Clojure\nBuilding a Clojure project with Leiningen generates a Java jar file, a packaged version of your application.  A jar file generated from Java can be run using java -jar jar-file-name.jar.  However to run your Clojure jar file as a Java application you also need to include the the Clojure core library.\nLeiningen can also generate an Uberjar.  The uberjar is a jar file that also includes the Clojure library as well as your application and libraries.  As the uberjar contains Clojure, you can run an uberjar in any Java environment.\nBy adding an :uberjar entry to the project.clj then the Leiningen command lein uberjar is run during the build and an uberjar is created.\nWhen deploying on Heroku your application is built from your codebase using Leiningen, pulling in all the libraries your application depends on.  When your application is run it is done so as a Java application using only the uberjar, starting just the one JVM.\nFurther reading: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-support\nTheory: Identifying an entry point for your application\nIf your main namespace doesn’t have a :gen-class then you can use clojure.main as your entry point and indicate your app’s main namespace using the -m argument in your Procfile:\nweb: java $JVM_OPTS -cp target/myproject-standalone.jar clojure.main -m myproject.web\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"projects/leiningen/todo-app/heroku/deploy.html":{"url":"projects/leiningen/todo-app/heroku/deploy.html","title":"Deploy to Heroku","keywords":"","body":"Deploy to Heroku\nFirst we need to create an Heroku app to deploy our Clojure webapp to.

This keeps your code very simple as you can guarantee there are no side effects due to other parts of your code changing state.\nSharing data\nIt may seem inefficient to create a new copy of a data structure each time, especially when working on very large data structure.  Clojure creates very efficient copies, by sharing elements from the original data structure.\n\n  Clojure manages data internally as a binary tree.Read the Polymathica article on Clojure Persistent Vectors for more details.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"persistent-data-structures/lists.html":{"url":"persistent-data-structures/lists.html","title":"Theory: Lists","keywords":"","body":"Theory: Lists\nList is a general set of elements with a sequential lookup time.  New elements are added to the front of the list as this is the most efficient way to update a list.\nYou can use the list function to create a new list (try the following expressions in a REPL)\n(list 1 2 3 4)\n(list )    ;; creates an empty list\n(list 1 2 \"three\" [4] five '(6 7 8 9))\n(list -1 -0.234 0 1.3 8/5 3.1415926)\n(list \"cat\" \"dog\" \"rabit\" \"fish\" 12 22/7)\n(list :cat :dog :rabit :fish)\n\nYou can mix types because Clojure is dynamic and it will work it out later, you can even have functions as elements, because a function always returns a value.  In the following example we define a list that includes a function call to the str function that joins its parameters into a single string.\n(list :cat 1 \"fish\" 22/7 (str \"fish\" \"n\" \"chips\"))\n\nLists evaluate as function calls\nOne unique thing about lists is that the first element is always evaluated as a function call, with the remaining elements as arguments.  So, defining a list just using () will cause an error\n(1 2 3 4)   ;; failing expression\n\nThe previous list definition fails because there is no function defined with the name 1\nWe can call any of our own functions or any functions from Clojure using a list\n(str \"The str function\" \" \" \"joins strings together\")\n(+ 1 2 3 4 5)  ;; + is a function that adds numbers\n(apply * [2 4 6])  ;; applies the * function to each element in the collection\n\nTreat lists as data\nThere is a special function called quote that tells Clojure to treat all the elements of the list as data.  You can also use the short-hand quote character, '\n(quote (1 2 3 4))\n\n'(1 2 3 4)\n\nSo using the quote character we can define lists very easily and concisely.\n'(-1 -0.234 0 1.3 8/5 3.1415926)\n'(\"cat\" \"dog\" \"rabit\" \"fish\")\n'(:cat :dog :rabit :fish)\n'(:cat 1 \"fish\" 22/7 (str \"fish\" \"n\" \"chips\"))\n\nDuplicate elements in a list\nA list can contain elements that are the same value.\n(list 1 2 3 4 1)\n(list \"one\" \"two\" \"one\")\n(list :fred :barney :fred)\n\nIf you wish to ensure only unique values then you can use a set\nChanging lists with the cons function\nAs we have seen in the introduction to this section, changing a lists values once created is not possible.  However when a list is used as the paramter to a function call it can return a new list with different values.\nThe cons function is used to add values to the list\n(cons 5 '(1 2 3 4))\n\n;; => (5 1 2 3 4)\n\nYou will notice that the value 5 is added to the front of the new list that is returned.  As this is a linked list and not indexed, it is more performant to add values to the front of a list.\nHere is another example with strings\n(cons \"fish\" '(\"and\" \"chips\"))\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"persistent-data-structures/maps.html":{"url":"persistent-data-structures/maps.html","title":"Theory: Maps","keywords":"","body":"Theory: Maps\nA map in Clojure is a collection of key & value pairs in the form {key value}.
