## Batching queries

using next.jdbc and am doing a batch insert using next.jdbc.prepare/execute-batch!It is working as expected but then following the instructions here https://cljdoc.org/d/seancorfield/next.jdbc/1.1.569/doc/getting-started/prepared-statements#batched-parameters
I and trying to use .getGeneratedKeys to get the results set back and it only returns the last batch to be inserted not the entire set.
Is this expected behaviour? (edited)

I sort of understand why, it is stateful and .getGeneratedKeys would need to be called in between each call to .executeBatch?

@sofra Yeah, it's a bit of an edge case. Different databases behave differently on this, unfortunately.

:thumbsup:

Some databases will return all generated keys (from all batches executed), some don't return any keys at all.
sofra  06:06
Thanks @seancorfield, makes sense
seancorfield  06:07
(hence all the caveats on that page :slightly_smiling_face: )

How big is the batch you're inserting @sofra?
seancorfield  06:16
If it's large enough to cause multiple .executeBatch calls, I can understand you only getting one set of keys back. I guess I could modify execute-batch! so that if :return-keys is truthy, it could attempt to call .getGeneratedKeys each time internally and return the result sets joined together. It seems like a reasonable enhancement, although I'd need to ensure it doesn't break existing behavior (so, probably another option as well as :return-keys I suspect).

@seancorfield it is a few thousand rows. Thanks for the info. I can work around it now I understand. Sounds like a reasonable enhancement to me too.
seancorfield  06:35
@sofra Are you specifying the :batch-size option to execute-batch! or just letting it do its thing?
sofra  06:36
yeah I was specifying it
seancorfield  06:36
If you don't specify it, .executeBatch will only be called once and .getGeneratedKeys should return all the keys -- but that may too much data for a single batch.
06:37
Anyway, I'll add that enhancement probably this week and put out a new release by the end of next weekend at the latest.

Thanks @seancorfield I was batching since it was too much for a regular mutli-insert! and the db was throwing errors. That is why I figured I would need to set :batch-size but I didnâ€™t actually test that assumption.
