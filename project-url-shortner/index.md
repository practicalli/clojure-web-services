# Project: URL Shortner as a Service

In this section we will build a webservice to create short url's for web addresses, as with services such as [bit.ly](https://bit.ly).

The web service will also manage the redirection of your browser from the short url to the real web address.

This project will take the simplest approach and is therefore not attempting to build a production ready service.
