# Content plan for Clojure WebApps book
Thanks to the support from Clojurists Together the Clojure WebApps book is being updated to add more content and cover more libraries.

Content will also move to using Clojure CLI tools and deps.edn projects, although the Leiningen content will remain available.

## Project ideas
[Ideas for projects to implement](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-webapps-content/issues) are most welcome

* Dependency graph using SVG graphics
* TODO / Kanban application
* Status monitor (SVG Graphics)
* User Management website (demonstrating how to make this usable for other projects)
* Content API for video (targeted searching for finding very specific content on YouTube)
* Financial services API's - online banking, personal insurance, stock tracking (mock stocks)
* API's for a mobile application - Scoreboards, chat boards, rewards, profiles, evil chat bots
