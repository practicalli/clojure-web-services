## Book overview

A Practical guide to building server-side web services and API's using [the Clojure programming language](http://clojure.org), a pragmatic functional programming language.

The guide provides simple and clean designs and code examples, encouraging effective use of the Clojure language.

A [REPL Driven Development workflow](https://practical.li/clojure-web-services/introduction/repl-workflow/) provides fast feedback, so you can see exactly what the code does as its being written.

Relevant theory and background reading is included whilst keeping the practical focus of this guide on build projects and experimenting with the code.

## GitHub Actions

The megalinter GitHub actions will run when a pull request is created,checking basic markdown syntax.

A review of the change will be carried out by the Practicalli team and the PR merged if the change is acceptable.

The Publish Book GitHub action will run when PR's are merged into main (or the Practicalli team pushes changes to the default branch).

Publish book workflow installs Material for MkDocs version 9


## Local development

Install mkdocs version 9 using the Python pip package manager

```bash
pip3 install mkdocs-material=="9.4"
```

Install the plugins used by the Practicalli site using Pip (these are also installed in the GitHub Action workflow)

```bash
pip3 install mkdocs-material mkdocs-callouts mkdocs-glightbox mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mkdocs-redirects pillow cairosvg
```

> pillow and cairosvg python packages are required for [Social Cards](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards/)

Fork the GitHub repository and clone that fork to your computer,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<repository>.git

```

Run a local server from the root of the cloned project

```bash
make docs
```

The website will open at <http://localhost:8000>

If making smaller changes, then only rebuild the content that changes, speeding up the local development process

```bash
make docs-changed
```
